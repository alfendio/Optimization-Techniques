## Travelling Salesman Problem 🚶‍♂️
### Coursework 1
- A salesman must visit many n cities. Every city is exactly visited once. From the last city, the salesman back to the original city. 
- The goal to be achieved is to find the best route.
- In this case, the route distance is used to determine the quality of the route made.
- The distance between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.

## Differential Evolution 👨‍🔬
### 6th Class Meeting (9 June 2022)
- Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based metaheuristic.
- DE was introduced by Storn and Price as a metaheuristic method for solving continuous problems (Storn and Price 1995).
- DE has 3 control parameters, namely population size, F scale factor, and CR crossover probability.
