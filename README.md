# 🚀 Optimization Techniques 

## Genetic Algorithm 🧬
### 4th Class Meeting (31 May 2022)
GA basic procedure:
- Population initialization
- Selection
- Reproduction
- Elitism
- Output

## Travelling Salesman Problem 🚶‍♂️
### Coursework 1
- A salesman must visit many n cities. Every city is exactly visited once. From the last city, the salesman back to the original city. 
- The goal to be achieved is to find the best route.
- In this case, the route distance is used to determine the quality of the route made.
- The distance between cities is calculated using the Euclidean distance.

## Differential Evolution 👨‍🔬
### 6th Class Meeting (9 June 2022)
- Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based metaheuristic.
- DE was introduced by Storn and Price as a metaheuristic method for solving continuous problems (Storn and Price 1995).
- DE has 3 control parameters, namely population size, F scale factor, and CR crossover probability.

## Differential Evolution for Continuous Problem 👩‍🔬
### Coursework 2
- Implementation of the DE algorithm for continuous problem on two x variables, to find the minimum with the sphere function f(x) = sum(xi^2), with the lower limit = -10, and the upper limit = 10.
- Continuous problem is a  problem whose decision variables are expressed in continuous values.
- Continuous problems can be divided into:
1. Unimodal function: a function that has only 1 extreme value (maximum/minimum).
2. Multimodal function: a function that only has >1 extreme value (maximum/minimum) so that it has a local optima value.

## Harmony Search Algorithm 🎼
### Coursework 3
- Harmony Search is a metaheuristic method inspired by the process of improvising music, especially jazz music. 
- This method was introduced by Geem Kim and Loganathan in 2001. 
- There are 3 possibilities in improvising music with Harmony Search, which are expressed in HMCR, PAR and Random Selection.

## Ant Colony Optimization 🐜
### 10th Class Meeting (28 June 2022)
- The process of foraging ant colonies is used as an analogy in ant colony optimization (ACO).
- This method was introduced by Marco Dorigo in 1992.
- In ACO, evaporation and pheromone deposition process is very important in balancing intensification and diversification.

## Particle Swarm Optimization 🐟🐦
### 12th Class Meeting (5 July 2022)
- Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique that is inspired by the intelligent collective behaviour of certain animals, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish.
